#ZSH
For help in setting up ZSH files on Macbooks, follow (this guide)[https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/jazz-up-your-zsh-terminal-in-seven-steps-a-visual-guide-e81a8fd59a38/]

The current themes I like to have installed are:
* Agnoster

I customise Agnoster by changing the length of the prompt, returning only the closest 3 levels of file structure. This is customised by modifying the `~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/agnoster.zsh-theme` file, changing the function

```
prompt_dir() {
  prompt_segment blue $CURRENT_FG '%3~'
}
```

It may also be necessary to modify the theme to more accurately display warning colours for the configured AWS profile. There is a function called `prompt_aws` that handles this.

With the colour themes:
* AlienBlood
* Argonaut

With additional plugins:
* zsh-syntax-highlighting
* zsh-autosuggestions

Instructions for installing plugins and colours can be found in the guide linked above.



To use the zshrc file in this repo, add this block of code to the .zshrc file that is autogenerated by oh-my-zsh

```
if [ -f $HOME/git/dotfiles/zshrc ]; then
    . $HOME/git/dotfiles/zshrc
fi
```
