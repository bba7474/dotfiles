#ZSH
For help in setting up ZSH files on Macbooks, follow (this guide)[https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/jazz-up-your-zsh-terminal-in-seven-steps-a-visual-guide-e81a8fd59a38/]

The current themes I like to have installed are:
* AlienBlood
* Argonaut
* BananaBlueberry
* Batman

To use the zshrc file in this repo, add this block of code to the .zshrc file that is autogenerated by oh-my-zsh

```
if [ -f $HOME/git/dotfiles/zshrc ]; then
    . $HOME/git/dotfiles/zshrc
fi
```

TODO: figure out how to stop the oh-my-zsh git plugin overwriting our gp function alias
